### As an **industry researcher** in AI: 
- I use machine learning and statistical methods to build AI applications in ophthalmology. I have also filed two patents in medical AI.
- This [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589419620301848), published in the clinical journal _Ophthalmology Glaucoma_, uses deep convolutional neural networks to assess the visual functions of glaucoma patients based on OCT scans of the retina.
  - The souce code, written in Python and Keras,  Will be released as an open source package by IBM Research.
- This [paper](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/44/eaaz8673), published in the high impact journal _Science Advances_, uses unsupervised machine learning algorithms (implemented in Tensorflow) to solve a problem in neuroscience.
  - [This](https://github.com/hsinhaoyu/DM_Retinotopy/) is an implementation of the algorithm (written in python and tensorflow).
  - [This](https://github.com/hsinhaoyu/spherical_elastic_net) is an extension of the algorithm for spherical coordinates.

### As a **data scientist**:
- I have 10 years of experience curating and analyzing physiological and clinical data. Also experienced in the negotiation and sharing/licensing of clinical data.
- [This GitHub repo](https://github.com/hsinhaoyu/bayesian-rf) is a sample project that uses classical and Bayesian methods to analyze a dataset in visual neuroscience. The code (presented as a Jupyter notebook) is written in R and the Bayesian package JAGS.
- [This GitHub repo](https://github.com/hsinhaoyu/koala_brain_analysis) is a sample project that demonstrates the role of data science in education. I wrote [an article](https://www.hhyu.org/posts/koala/) about it.
- This [gallery](https://hhyu.org/gallery/) is a portfolio of my data visualization work.
- [Topy](https://github.com/hsinhaoyu/topy) is a package I developed for analyzing and visualizing data collected on spherical surfaces. It's a type of type common in visual neuroscience. `Topy` has been used to generate beautiful figures in several publications.
- Examples of techniques used in published work:
    - Mixed effect linear models: [Yu et al. (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589419620301848)
	- Nonlinear model fitting, Bayesian model selection: [Yu et al. (2010)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2010.07118.x)
	- ANCOVA (analysis of covariance): [Yu et al. (2013)](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/30/12479.long)
	- Circular statistics: [Yu & Rosa ( 2013)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/visual-neuroscience/article/abs/uniformity-and-diversity-of-response-properties-of-neurons-in-the-primary-visual-cortex-selectivity-for-orientation-direction-of-motion-and-stimulus-size-from-center-to-far-periphery/7CAA7AB6713B67DFEAE7FEB51DA34774)
	- Resampling and permutation tests: [Hadjidimitrakis et al. (2019)](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/27/5311.abstract)
- Other techniques: multivariate statistics, dimension reduction, matrix decomposition... etc.

### As a **vision scientist** and **neuroscientist**:
- I used electrophysiology, imaging, and computational modeling to study a diverse range of topics, including brain mapping, neuroplasticity, evolution, neuroanatomy, and the processing of visual signals.
- See my [Research page](https://hhyu.org/research) for details.

### As a **science communicator**:
- I have published a series of [popular science articles](https://www.thenewslens.com/author/hhyu00) about neuroscience, vision, and history of science for the Chinese-speaking community.
- I also write an English blog in my own site. An [article](https://medium.com/cortically-magnified/estimating-the-number-of-photons-that-hit-the-eye-c0208e7e0b64) that I posted on Medium in 2016  has accumulated more than 10,000 views.
- [This article](https://www.hhyu.org/posts/koala/) uses data science to debunk a myth about koalas.

### Others:
- [This](https://github.com/hsinhaoyu/hugo_theme_pickles/tree/a70c081055d0a2f57d6ae6679139b76b046c8cae) is a customized theme (derived from the [Pickles](https://github.com/mismith0227/hugo_theme_pickles) theme) for the Hugo static website generator. This version supports a "micro blog" format. It also supports various IndieWeb protocols. See [this post](https://www.hhyu.org/posts/website_tutorial/) for details.
