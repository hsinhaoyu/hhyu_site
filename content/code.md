#### Web apps

- [Parallel Timelines](https://gitlab.com/hsinhaoyu/timelinedb): A webapp for comparing multiple lines of historical events in parallel. Written in NodeJS and React.

#### Data analysis

- [Bayesian regression](https://github.com/hsinhaoyu/bayesian-rf): An application of Bayesian methods in visual neuroscience. I used Bayesian regression to characterize the scaling relationship between receptive field size and eccentricity. Written in R and the Bayesian package JAGS.

- [The allometry of mammalian brains](https://github.com/hsinhaoyu/koala_brain_analysis): I wrote a general-audience [article](https://www.hhyu.org/posts/koala/) to debunk a myth surrounding the size of brains. This is the R source code for the analysis.


#### Literate programs
Inspired by the [Programs to Read](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs.html) section of Professor Donald Knuth's website, I am enthusiastic about [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) - the art and science of developing computer programs as an integral part of writing.

- [Why Functional Programming Matters](https://github.com/hsinhaoyu/why_functional) - An intermediate-level tutorial on Python's generators, based on John Hughes' classic paper "Why Function Programming Matters", which was written in the lazy functional language Miranda.

- [Continued fraction arithmetic](https://github.com/hsinhaoyu/cont_frac) - A Python implementation of Bill Gosper's algorithm for performing arithmetic operations on continued fractions. I also wrote an [article](https://hsinhaoyu.github.io/cont_frac/) to explain the logic.
