#### Data analysis

#### Literate programs
Inspired by the [Programs to Read](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs.html) section of Professor Donald Knuth's website, I am enthusiastic about writing programs that can also be read as essays.

- [Why Functional Programming Matters](https://github.com/hsinhaoyu/why_functional) - An intermediate-level tutorial on Python's generators, based on John Hughes' classic paper "Why Function Programming Matters", which was written in the lazy functional language Miranda.
