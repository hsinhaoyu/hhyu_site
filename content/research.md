Some of the topics in neuroscience that I have worked on:

### Current Research: Machine Learning and Functional Brain Imaging
In 2016, I was awarded research grants from the Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council to use machine learning methods on the analysis of neurophysiolgical data. In addition, I am also working on new methodologies to imagine the activities of the visual cortex. Initial findings will be published in the near future.

### Mapping the Visual Cortex
In 2012, I identified a new component of the visual cortex called _area prostriata_ using electrophysiological recordings. This area is _weird_. It seems to devote most of its resource to the processing of information in the far peripheral visual field (close to the edge of vision), and it seems to be a short-cut for visual information be integrated with non-visual areas in the brain, bypassing most of hierarchy of the visual cortex.

- The area was confirmed in the human brain using fMRI in 2017. See Mikellidou _et al._ (2017) Area Prostriata in the Human Brain. _Current Biology_ 27, 3056-3060. [[link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28966090)]

- There is (interestingly) a prostriata hashtag on twitter: [#prostriata](https://twitter.com/hashtag/prostriata?src=hash).

### Plasticity and Development
From 2012 to 2017, I conducted a long-term study about how the visual pathways are altered by brain injuries, especially at the early stages of development. This research is related to a mysterious phenomenon called [blindsight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight).

### Evolution
My collaborator Tristan Chaplin and I tried to answer the question: do we have big brains because we are smarter? I wanted to publish the result under the title "Larger before Smarter", but that probably was too cute. I also co-authored a book chapter on this topic.

### Computational Neuroscience
My main interest is the representation of the trajectories of moving images in the visual cortex.

### Peripheral Vision
The biggest difference between human vision and computer vision is that human vision is spatially non-uniform: we have a fovea which is specialized for high acuity. But the functional implications of this important difference are not clear. A [review article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168010214002156) I wrote might be useful for those interested in this topic.

### Others
- Computational anatomy and digital atlasing: I contributed to the early development of the [Marmoset Brain Architecture Project](http://marmoset.braincircuits.org).
- A significant part of my work has been done with a display system that projects panoramic  patterns to a spherical surface. The design and implementation is described in [here](http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2193721).
