### Computational neuroscience 

**The formation of retinotopic maps in the visual cortex**

In early visual cortex, adjacent retinotopic maps tend to be mirror images of each other, but does this organization extend to higher-order areas? In order to understand the general principles of the organization of adjacent maps, I used computational models to study how the development of a retinotopic map could be influenced by its neighbors. The result suggests a novel arrangement can emerge, which can explain the unconventional retinotopy of the dorsal visual cortex.

**The cortical representation of moving patterns**

Encoding moving patterns in the visual cortex is a complex question with many unresolved problems. I examined the ambiguity in the representation of motion speed, and how it can be reduced when the object moves in a trajectory.

### Brain mapping

**Controversies surrounding the third-tier primate visual areas**

Which visual area lies rostral to area V2? The conventional answer is area V3, but many controversies remain (see [this review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26241792/)). My colleagues and I mapped the dorsomedial (DM) region of the marmoset visual cortex using high-resolution electrode arrays, and showed that the retinotopy was consistent with the organization described in [Rosa & Schmid (1995)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7499529/), [Sereno et al. (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4733890/), and [Zhu et al. (2019)](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/6/2306.abstract).

**Area prostriata**

In 2012, my colleagues and I identified a new component of the visual cortex called _area prostriata_ using electrophysiological recordings. This area is _weird_. It seems to devote most of its resource to the processing of information in the far peripheral visual field (close to the edge of vision), and it seems to be a short-cut for visual information be integrated with non-visual areas in the brain, bypassing most of hierarchy of the visual cortex.

- There is (interestingly) a prostriata hashtag on twitter: [#prostriata](https://twitter.com/hashtag/prostriata?src=hash).

### Plasticity and Development
From 2012 to 2017, I conducted a series of studies about how the visual pathways are altered by brain injuries, especially at the early stages of development. This research is related to a mysterious phenomenon called [blindsight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight).

### Evolution
My collaborator Tristan Chaplin and I tried to answer the question: do we have big brains because we are smarter? I wanted to publish the result under the title "Larger before Smarter", but that probably was too cute. I also co-authored a book chapter on this topic.

### Peripheral Vision
The biggest difference between human vision and computer vision is that human vision is spatially non-uniform: we have a fovea which is specialized for high acuity. But the functional implications of this important difference are not clear. A [review article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168010214002156) I wrote might be useful for those interested in this topic.
