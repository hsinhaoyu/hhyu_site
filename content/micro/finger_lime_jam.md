I bought this jam made from the native Australian plant [finger lime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrus_australasica) *Citrus australasica*.  I wasn’t expecting much because with enough sugar, all jams taste alike. But this is very different. At the first taste, it’s like a citrus but then the citrus taste is replaced by something very bitter. It’s weird. I will have no problem finishing this jar.
