In the 70's, it was fashionable for intellectuals to abuse the term "grammar" to refer to any underlying principles. In one of  his essays, Italo Calvino used the term "the grammar of tree" to refer to.... essentially developmental plant biology. I thought that was pretentious. But heh, in R programming, people are talking about the grammar of graphics or data manipulations. It's fashionable to call functions "verbs" again. Hello, structuralism!
