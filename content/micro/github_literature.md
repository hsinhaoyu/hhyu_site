I want to see writers use GitHub for literary experimentation. It can be a new form of [ergodic literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_literature?wprov=sfti1). Imagine a novel released as a GitHub repo. Readers can read it. They can check out all the branches to explore parallel universes of alternative plots. They can read the revision history as a meta-novel, to learn about the writing process. And of course, they can make new versions of the novel by merging branches. It’s like Borges’ _Garden of Forking Paths_ taken to the next level.
