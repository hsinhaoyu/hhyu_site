I was reading about the Emacs [org-roam mode](https://www.orgroam.com), and came across the [Zettelkasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten?wprov=sfti1) of notetaking. I hadn’t seen this term before, but the idea of taking notes with cross-referenced index cards sounded familiar. Where did I read about it? Ah yes... in Umberto Eco’s _Foucault’s Pendulum_, the main character Casaubon (an ex-academic who  makes a living as a “detective of knowledge”) uses boxes of index cards to keep track of ideas. I wouldn’t be surprised that Eco himself did this religiously. He apparently [recommended it ](http://www.dansheffler.com/blog/2015-08-10-reading-notes/) to PhD students.
