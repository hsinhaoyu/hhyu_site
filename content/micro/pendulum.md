The plot of Umberto Eco's novel _Foucault's Pendulum_ involves two publishers: Garamond and Manutius. Both refer to publishers of the 16 century: [Claude Garamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Garamond) and [Aldus Manutius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus_Manutius). Interestingly both names are relatable to Apple. The Garamond font was used in Apple's logo, and Aldus Co. was the original developer of PageMaker (a killer app for the Macintosh) before it was acquired by Adobe.
