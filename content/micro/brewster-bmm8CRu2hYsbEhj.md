I have been reading Italo Calvino’s [If on a winters night a traveller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_on_a_winter's_night_a_traveler). One chapter is particularly interesting because it draws heavily on the imagery of optics (one of Calvino's obsessions). It makes a reference to the 19th century British scientist [David Brewster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brewster?wprov=sfti1) for his invention of the kaleidoscope. I hadn't read about Brewster before so I had to look him up. He was so much more than the inventor of kaleidoscope. He was a major figure in 19th century optics, and made important discoveries about the polarisation of light.

This part of _If on a winter's night a traveller_ reminded me of Thomas Pynchon's [Against the Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_the_Day), which also uses optics as a central metaphor. Interestingly, Against the Day makes references to [Augustin Fresnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Jean_Fresnel?wprov=sfti1) and [Étienne-Louis Malus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne-Louis_Malus?wprov=sfti1), but apparently not to Brewster.
