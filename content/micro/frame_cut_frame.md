One music album that I used to play a lot of was called [Night of Short Lives](https://www.discogs.com/Frame-Cut-Frame-Night-Of-Short-Lives/release/315587). It was published in the 90's under the artist name _Frame Cut Frame_. It's very hard to describe what kind of music it was. The publisher called it "unclassical music", because the music had the classical texture, but not the classical form.

The CD was just one of those random things that I had. I don’t remember why I had it. I had no idea who made it or why it was made. It was published by an independent Belgian label called SubRosa so I had assumed that it’s European. But I just discovered it’s Australian! The music is by Brett Dean, with sampled sounds by Simon Hunt. [Brett Dean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Dean) turns out to be not just a random Aussie who made this obscure album. Wikipedia shows that he is one of the most celebrated Australian musicians!
