Finished William Gibson’s _Count Zero_. I like William Gibson. There are things that he did extremely well in this novel. But it doesn’t work. The three main threads of narrative are all interesting ideas by themselves, but they don’t add up to a meaningful big picture. In the end, I don’t understand why anything happened. I was planning to read _Mona Lisa Overdrive_ after this one, but maybe not. The second half of _Count Zero_ seems too clumsily written for me.
