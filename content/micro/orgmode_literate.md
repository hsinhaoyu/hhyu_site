About a month ago, I rewrote my Emacs config script in the style of literate programming. Emacs has a markup language (org-mode) that makes it easy to mix rich text with code. I did it mostly out of curiosity. At that time, I didn’t know if writing something as trivial as a config file this way was a good idea in terms of practicality. After a month of tweaking, I am now convinced that It was helpful. Literate programs are meant to be read. Do I care about reading my config file? The answer is yes. Emacs config can be pretty long and arcane. Since I am not well-versed in the Emacs deep secrets, it’s very useful to make it enjoyable to read. Given this very positive experience, I am looking into writing more literate code with Emacs.
