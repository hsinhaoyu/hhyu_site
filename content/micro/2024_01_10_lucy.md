Today I visited the National Natural History Museum in Taichung, and I found the exact location where I was introduced to the music of the Beatles!

It was a school excursion when I was a boy. In the anthropological hall of the museum, there was a display of the site in Ethiopia where Donald Johanson discovered Australopithecus. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was playing because thatâ€™s the music Johanson was listening to while his team dug up Lucy. I actually paid no attention to any of these facts, because I was listening to the music. After that excursion, I bought Beatles albums one by one until I found Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.

I returned to the museum after decades living abroad, and I was very happy to have discovered that the museum has been playing Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds continuously all these years.
