A friend told me about Su Hui's [Star Gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Gauge). It is is a matrix poem composed in the 4th century by the Chinese poetess Su Hui. The characters are arranged in a 29x29 matrix. The submatrices can be read in different directions, producing (apparently) 3000 poems.
