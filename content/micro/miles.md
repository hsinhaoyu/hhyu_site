A mini-review of the recently released "Miles Davis John Coltrane The Final Tour: The Bootleg Series, Vol. 6" album. The first track of the album, recorded in 1960 in a live show in Paris, documents a dramatic moment in the history of modern music. The European concert goers were expecting the dreamy world of Kind of Blue and some pleasant show tunes. They didn't know that John Coltrane was going to unleash the furious sounds of the future to them. And Miles just let him do what he had to do. It was like the Enchantment Under the Sea scene in Back to the Future, where Marty McFly channeled Eddie van Halen in his cover of  Johnny B. Goode.
