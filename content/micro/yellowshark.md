My wife and I have a box of CDs that we hadn’t opened in maybe 10 years. We moved them across three continents because we don’t want to get rid of them, but with streaming services, we had very little reason to take them out of the box. We don’t even have a CD player in the house anymore. But there are treasures. We finally decided to take them out during the break. I can stream Frank Zappa’s Yellow Shark anytime I want, but it’s very hard to find this booklet. It’s a really good booklet with pictures, stories, and even some sheet music.
