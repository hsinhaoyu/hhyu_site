A tribute to [_Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_McKracken_and_the_Alien_Mindbenders), an old adventure game.  The game has the greatest cover art ever.  I haven't played the game myself, but what could the plot be?  Zak McKracken, a tabloid journalist is holding a baguette and a fishbowl, standing on a pile of fallen alien guitarists in cowboy hats.  There is a broom with a face, a two-headed squirrel, and a girl holding a Groucho-Marx mask.  Somebody should turn it into a children's book.
