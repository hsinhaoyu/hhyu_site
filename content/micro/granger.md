I walked past Melbourne University’s Grainger Museum, which is dedicated to the Australian composer [Percy Grainger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Grainger). Kudos to the Wiggles for adapting one of his compositions into a [children’s song](https://wiggles.fandom.com/wiki/When_I_Hear_the_Music_of_the_Orchestra).
