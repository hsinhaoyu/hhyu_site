My family has been watching the _Penn & Teller: Fool Us_ TV series. I was reminded of a 2008 [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2473) published in _Nature Review Neuroscience_ about the psychological aspects of magic. Teller was listed as a co-author (among several well-known magicians). There is a very remarkable sentence in the paper: "One of the authors of this Perspective (referring to Apollo Robbins) is a professional thief."
