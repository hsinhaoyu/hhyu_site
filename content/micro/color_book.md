_Bright Earth_ by Philip Ball is a remarkably multidisciplinary book about color. In a chapter about renaissance art, he described the technique of _cangiantismo_, which is most famously associated with the work of Michangelo. [Wikipedia’s entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangiante?wprov=sfti1) explains: “Cangiante is characterized by a change in color necessitated by an original color's darkness or lightness limitation”. The effect is unnatural but it’s what fascinates me most about Michangelo’s paintings. 

This [article](https://www.glennis.net/post/michelangelo-cangiantismo) explains how the technique was used in contemporary art such as Monster Inc.
