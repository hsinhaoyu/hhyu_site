_Collection of Sand_ is a collection of book reviews, exhibition reviews and travelogues that Italo Calvino wrote in the 70's and 80's. The quality varies. The best of them are unsurprisingly ekphrastic essays where Calvino described gardens, historical sites, and paintings in exquisite details. Those where he tried to regurgitate scientific or historical knowledge from academic books are less inspiring. But still, it is the variety of things that Calvino cared to write about that charms. I haven't encountered another book that talks about so many arcane things in one place. The vast majority of the notes that I made below have no relevance to anything that I do. Sometimes it just feels good to indulge myself to read about random subjects such as... the first giraffe in Paris...

In 2015, I visited [Museo Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_Galileo?wprov=sfti1) in Florence. I became facscinated by a beautiful world map in a room about navigation, and I vaguely remembered that it was mentioned in _Collection of Sand_.  A quick consultation with the ebook in my phone...  and indeed, it was the Fra Mauro 1450 world map (a replica, that is), described in an essay titled _The traveller in the map_. It was apparently the first map that made Europe looked so small. The museum also displayed some anatomical models by Clemente Susini - who was mentioned in _The museum of wax monsters_.  This was the only time in my life that I saw some of the things that Calvino wrote about.

## I. Exhibitions - Explorations 
### Collection of sand
Calvino wondered why anyone would be interested  in collecting sands, in an exhibition in Paris about bizarre collections.
