I can’t be the only one who has trouble reading comic books. I have problems interpolating between the panels, and I find it hard to recognise the characters. In other words, I don’t know how one panel is related to the next, and I don’t know who’s who. Reading comic books to me is like a simulation of cortical lesions. It induces a mild form of [akinetopsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akinetopsia)(deficit in the perception of motion) and [prosopagnosia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia) (deficit in the perception of faces).
