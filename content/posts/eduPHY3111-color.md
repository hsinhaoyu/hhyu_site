### Animal colour vision
- A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH84_XipdNs) about animal colour vision
- In earlier versions of my lecture, I said that the Austrian zoologist Karl von Frisch was the first person to show that non-human animals had colour vision. This is historically incorrect. His groundbreaking research in 1914 was the first to show that insects (specifically, the honeybee) had colour vision. He was also the first person to show that goldfish had color vision. His findings are important because it was thought that only mammals had colour vision.
