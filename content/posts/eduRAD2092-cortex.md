### Myths debunked
- [Science says there's no such thing as a left-brain or right-brain thinker](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/left-brain-right-brain-thinker-myth-2015-3?r=US)
- [The truth about the left brain/right brain relationship](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2013/12/02/248089436/the-truth-about-the-left-brain-right-brain-relationship) by Tania Lombrozo.

### Neuroscience: too much hype?
- [The problems with the neuroscience backlash](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-problem-with-the-neuroscience-backlash): Neuroscience research is very often sensationalised in the media. You cannot believe everything that you read. However, you should not be overly skeptical.
