### Demonstrations:
- The reconstruction of Mona Lisa [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTSUjf6xQKQ).
- A blog [post](/posts/FourierDemonstration/) I wrote about the Fourier transform trick.
- Youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VdFf3egwfg): Nobel laureates David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel recording neurons in cat's V1.

### Suggested readings: Fourier transform
- An introduction to two-dimensional fast Fourier transforms and their applications by Rzeszotarski et al. (1983).
- Fourier transforms and frequency-domain processing (Chapter 5 of Fundamentals of Digital Image Processing: A Practical Approach with Examples in Matlab by Solomon & Breckon, 2011)

### Suggested readings: programming
-  See this [web page](http://www.ece.ucsb.edu/Faculty/Rabiner/ece259/image_processing_labs/lab3_solution.pdf) from UCSB.

### Suggested readings: psychology and neuroscience
- Textbook: [Foundations of Vision](https://foundationsofvision.stanford.edu) (1995) by Brian Wandell (read Chapter 7)
- Spatial Vision (1988) by Russell De Valois and Karen De Valois.

### Interesting stuff:
- [Why zebras have stripes (hint: itâ€™s not for camouflage)](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2016/01/31/why-zebras-have-stripes-hint-its-not-for-camouflage/) - an example of using image processing (similar to the cat vision example we used in class) to understand animal vision, evolution, and ecology.
- Oliva (2013) The Art of Hybrid Images: Two for the View of One. Art & Perception 1, 65-74. This paper provides more details about the "Dr. Angry and Mr. Smile" illusion.
- A [gallery](http://cvcl.mit.edu/hybrid_gallery/gallery.html) of hybrid images.
- von Hofsten et al (2014). [Simulating newborn face perception](http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2213027). Can a newborn baby see well enough to recognise the facial expressions of the parents? Yes.
- [The ghostly gaze and the disappearing bust of Voltaire](https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2011/sep/19/ghostly-gaze-illusion). An article on The Age about illusions that we discussed in class.
- Bonnar et al (2002) [Understanding Dali's Slave market with the disappearing bust of Voltaire: a case study in the scale information driving perception](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12092795). Perception 31, 683-691. This research uses the frequency adaptation technique that we discussed to study the perception of a painting by Salvador Dali.
