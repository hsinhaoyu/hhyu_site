I got the idea from a photo of a clock that I found randomly on eBay. I thought that it was a novelty clock with a very unusual industrial design, but after a little while, I realized that what happened was that the seller took the hands part, and placed them haphazardly on the clock face. 

But it got me thinking, clock hands don't have to rotate around the center, if they are mounted on rotating discs. There are probably a lot of interesting things you can do with rotating discs. The [Ressence watch](https://ressencewatches.com), for example, is a weird watch based on the concept of orbiting discs.

So, here it is. A watch designed to look like it's broken. I think I actually want to have a watch like this.
