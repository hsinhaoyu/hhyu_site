I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/index.html) of University of California San Diego.For my undergraduate degree, I studied [Applied Mathematics](https://www.math.nctu.edu.tw/introduction/e_index.php) at the [National Chiao Tung University](https://www.nctu.edu.tw/en) in Hsin-Chu, Taiwan.

I have had several different roles in science and research:

As an **industry researcher** in medical AI: I use machine learning and statistical methods to build AI applications in ophthalmology. I also have experience in managing data sharing and collaboration with academic researchers.

As an **academic researcher** in neuroscience: Prior to September 2018, I was a neuroscientist working at the Department of Physiology, Monash University (Melbourne). My area of expertise was in the architecture of the primate visual cortex. I used electrophysiology, imaging, and computational modeling to study a diverse range of topics, including brain mapping, neuroplasticity, evolution, neuroanatomy, and the processing of visual signals.

As a **science communicator**: I have published a series of [popular science articles](https://www.thenewslens.com/author/hhyu00) about neuroscience, vision, and history of science for the Chinese-speaking community. I also write an English blog here and [elsewhere](https://medium.com/cortically-magnified/estimating-the-number-of-photons-that-hit-the-eye-c0208e7e0b64).

As a **teacher and mentor**: I gave undergrade lectures about neuroscience and computational neuroscience at Monash University. I have also supervised several Honours and PhD students.
