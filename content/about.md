I'm a neuroscientist working at the Department of Physiology, Monash University (Melbourne).  I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Cognitive Science in University of California San Diego in 2008. In the same year, I moved to Melbourne to work for Monash University. For my undergraduate degree, I studied Mathematics at the National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) in Hsin-Chu, Taiwan.

My primary research interest is the architetcure of the primate visual cortex. I have stduied a diverse range of topics, including brain mapping, evolution, neuroanatomy, computational neuroscience, and machine learning.
