I'm a research scientist working in the tech industry. My current research is focused on artificial intelligence and biomedical image analysis. I received my Ph.D. degree from the [Department of Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/index.html) of University of California San Diego in 2008. In the same year, I moved to Melbourne to work for Monash University. For my undergraduate degree, I studied [Applied Mathematics
(https://www.math.nctu.edu.tw/introduction/e_index.php) at the [National Chiao Tung University](https://www.nctu.edu.tw/en) in Hsin-Chu, Taiwan.

Prior to September 2018, I was a neuroscientist working at the Department of Physiology, Monash University (Melbourne). My area of expertise was in the architecture of the primate visual cortex. I used electrophysiology, imaging, and computational modeling to study a diverse range of topics, including brain mapping, neuroplasticity, evolution, neuroanatomy, and the processing of visual signals.
