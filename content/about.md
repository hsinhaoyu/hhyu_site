I am a data scientist and an AI/machine learning researcher in the technology industry. Prior to switching to the industry, I was a neuroscientist with expertise in the visual cortex.

I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/index.html) of University of California San Diego.For my undergraduate degree, I studied [Applied Mathematics](https://www.math.nctu.edu.tw/introduction/e_index.php) at the [National Chiao Tung University](https://www.nctu.edu.tw/en) in Hsin-Chu, Taiwan.
