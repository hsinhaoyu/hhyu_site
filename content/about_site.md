I wrote an in-depth [description](/posts/website_tutorial/) about how this site is built.

- The site is made with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static website generator, using a [customized theme](https://github.com/hsinhaoyu/hugo_theme_pickles/tree/58c56c1177338ae827bdbcaba94f727ba95ab23a) derived from the [Pickles](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo_theme_pickles/) theme.

- It has a [micropub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub) endpoint.
- It receives [micromention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention).
