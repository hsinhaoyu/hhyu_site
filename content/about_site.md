I started this site in 2018 to collect all my content in one place. The title "Cortically Magnified" is a play on "cortical magnification" - a concept in visual neuroscience. Roughly speaking, it measures the amount of resource in the visual cortex that is devoted to the processing of information in a small patch of the visual field. I have measured cortical magnification functions several times in my career as a neuroscientist.

- The site is made with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static website generator, using a [customized theme](https://github.com/hsinhaoyu/hugo_theme_pickles/tree/58c56c1177338ae827bdbcaba94f727ba95ab23a) derived from the [Pickles](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo_theme_pickles/) theme.
- I am working on supporting [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) -  an alternative approach to social networking based on open protocols.
- As of January 2021, this site supports [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.com) authentication and service discovery. Content can be updated from  [micropub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub) clients via a serverless application. 
- The site can receive [micromention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) via [webmention.io](https://webmention.io).

I wrote an in-depth [tutorial](/posts/website_tutorial/) to document the process that I am using to build this site.
