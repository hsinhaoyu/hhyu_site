      <description>Anticipating the next release of macOS (10.16; Big Sur), I started to read the novel Big Sur by Jack Kerouac. It&amp;rsquo;s very interesting to me that in Chapter 12, Kerouac went to visit Neal Cassady, who was living in the Santa Clara Valley (more precisely, 1047 E. Santa Clara Street). So, in the late 50&amp;rsquo;s, Neal Cassady was practically living in today&amp;rsquo;s Silicon Valley. I had never associated with Silicon Valley with the counterculture movement.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The loom for making stockings is one of the most complicated and rigorously logical machines that we have&amp;hellip; one could consider it as just one single piece of reasoning whose conclusion is the making of the stockings&amp;rdquo; - Denis Diderot, quoted in Italo Calvino&amp;rsquo;s Collection of Sand.</description>

      <description>One of the productivity tips that I have found useful is oddly from Ernest Hemingway (hardly a man of high productivity). He said that he always worked to a point where he knew how to continue, and then stopped working for the day. This way, he always had a good start the next day. I read about it in an article on creativity but didn&amp;rsquo;t know where it was from. I just discovered it’s from Hemingway’s memoir A Movable Feast, in a chapter about his interactions with Gertrude Stein (&amp;ldquo;Miss Stein Instructs).</description>

      <description>A parody of Jorge Luis Borges&amp;rsquo;s essay &amp;ldquo;A New Refutation of Time&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;The Third Refutation of Ordinality&amp;rdquo;. Or maybe &amp;ldquo;10 Arguments Against Cardinality&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>A mini-review of the recently released &amp;ldquo;Miles Davis John Coltrane The Final Tour: The Bootleg Series, Vol. 6&amp;rdquo; album. The first track of the album, recorded in 1960 in a live show in Paris, documents a dramatic moment in the history of modern music. The European concert goers were expecting the dreamy world of Kind of Blue and some pleasant show tunes. They didn&amp;rsquo;t know that John Coltrane was going to unleash the furious sounds of the future to them.</description>

      <description>A mathematician friend mentioned Frivolous Theorem of Arithmetic, which apparently states that &amp;ldquo;Almost all natural numbers are very, very, very large&amp;rdquo;. Me: But isn&amp;rsquo;t that obvious? Friend: That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s called frivolous.</description>

      <description>I am really liking an iOS puzzle game called Dissembler. The minimalist graphics is beautiful like a Bauhaus design. This is like a game that Paul Klee would have made.</description>

      <description>The plot of Umberto Eco&amp;rsquo;s novel Foucault&amp;rsquo;s Pendulum involves two publishers: Garamond and Manutius. Both names refer to figures in the history of printing: Claude Garamond designed the Garamond font in the 16th century, while Aldus Manutius was a famous 15th century printer who invented italic type, a few punctuation marks, and the pocketbook format. This might be a joke because both names are relatable to Apple. The Garamond font was used in Apple&amp;rsquo;s logo, and Aldus Co.</description>

      <description>Turing once dreamed that he was a Turing machine. When he woke up, he wondered if it was him who dreamed of being a Turing machine, or if it was a Turning machine which dreamed that it was Turing (a koan from a programming book published in Taiwan)</description>

      <description>Last week I went to see an optometrist. As he examined my eye with a strong light, I was amazed that I saw an image of the blood vessels on the retina. This phenomenon is called the entoptic image. It was first described by Purkinje about 200 years ago. I read about it in “How we perceive our own retina” by Kuno Kirschfeld (published in Proc. Bio. Sci.)</description>
