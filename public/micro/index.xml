      <description>A mathematician friend mentioned Frivolous Theorem of Arithmetic, which apparently states that &amp;ldquo;Almost all natural numbers are very, very, very large&amp;rdquo;. Me: But isn&amp;rsquo;t that obvious? Friend: That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s called frivolous.</description>

      <description>I am really liking an iOS puzzle game called Dissembler. The minimalist graphics is beautiful like a Bauhaus design. This is like a game that Paul Klee would have made.</description>

      <description>Anthropologists discovered that islanders in South Pacific have been using blockchains for thousands of years. All transactions are recorded by carving patterns on tree trunks, whose integrity is enforced by solving hard problems such as 12&amp;frasl;5.</description>

      <description>Just discovered that python&amp;rsquo;s numerical package has a function for Einstein summation for tensors. In the past, you need that for cosmology. These days you use them for neural networks.</description>

      <description>The plot of Umberto Eco&amp;rsquo;s novel Foucault&amp;rsquo;s Pendulum involves two publishers: Garamond and Manutius. Both refer to publishers of the 16 century: Claude Garamond and Aldus Manutius. Interestingly both names are relatable to Apple. The Garamond font was used in Apple&amp;rsquo;s logo, and Aldus Co. was the original developer of PageMaker (a killer app for the Macintosh) before it was acquired by Adobe.</description>

      <description>Turing once dreamed that he was a Turing machine. When he woke up, he wondered if it was him who dreamed of being a Turing machine, or if it was a Turning machine which dreamed that it was Turing (a koan from a programming book published in Taiwan)</description>

      <description>Last week I went to see an optometrist. As he examined my eye with a strong light, I was amazed that I saw an image of the blood vessels on the retina. This phenomenon is called the entoptic image. It was first described by Purkinje about 200 years ago. I read about it in “How we perceive our own retina” by Kuno Kirschfeld (published in Proc. Bio. Sci.)</description>

      <description>We need a journal that publishes papers in the style of the 18th century: long title, flowery prose, kudos to King and church, and extreme modesty.</description>
