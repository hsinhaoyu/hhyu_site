      <description>As a PhD student, I took a class in animal behaviour. I didn’t work very hard and have forgotten most of it. However, since I became a father, I have been thinking more about this class.

For example, Humphrey offered an interesting interpretation of Robinson Crusoe.</description>

      <description>Last week I went to see an optometrist. As he examined my eye with a strong light, I was amazed that I saw an image of the blood vessels on the retina. This phenomenon is called the entoptic image. It was first described by Purkinje about 200 years ago. I read about it in “How we perceive our own retina” by Kuno Kirschfeld (published in Proc. Bio. Sci.)</description>

      <description>What is known as the visual cortex today was thought to be the site of &amp;ldquo;philoprogenitivty” (parental love) in phrenology.</description>
