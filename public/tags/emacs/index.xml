      <description>I really like Donald Knuth&amp;rsquo;s idea of literate programming. Unfortunately, I don&amp;rsquo;t have too many opportunities to write literate programs. A couple of months ago, I was inspired by this article, and I decided to rewrite my Emacs configuration file using org-mode&amp;rsquo;s literate programming tool Babel.</description>

      <title>How I run emacs in client/server mode under macOS</title>

      <description>Many articles are available about running Emacs in client/server mode. However, when I tried to do it in my particular environment (macOS 11.0.1 Big Sur, using zsh), some tweaks were still needed. So I figured that it&amp;rsquo;s probably useful to document my setup.
In macOS, the Emacs executable is /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs. To run Emacs in its regular (non-server) operation mode, I defined two shell commands in .zshrc: emacs runs Emacs in GUI mode in a macOS window, whereas emacsnw runs Emacs in text mode within the terminal.</description>

      <description>About a month ago, I rewrote my Emacs config script in the style of literate programming. Emacs has a markup language (org-mode) that makes it easy to mix rich text with code. I did it mostly out of curiosity. At that time, I didnâ€™t know if writing something as trivial as a config file this way was a good idea in terms of practicality. After a month of tweaking, I am now convinced that It was helpful.</description>
