      <description>During the lockdown, I finally found the time to read the first volume of G.K. Chesterton&amp;rsquo;s Father Brown stories. In general, I can&amp;rsquo;t say I like them as detective stories, because what I am looking for in this genre is brilliant deduction, and Father Brown doesn&amp;rsquo;t do that kind of thing. However, I was very impressed by a story titled The Sign of the Broken Sword. It&amp;rsquo;s a very unusual detective story, in which Father Brown analyzed the accepted narrative of a (fictional) historical event, and concluded that the overlooked inconsistencies could only mean one thing: the narrative was manufactured to cover up a deeper, tragic truth.</description>
