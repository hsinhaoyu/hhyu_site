      <description>I have been reading Italo Calvino’s If on a winters night a traveller. One chapter is particularly interesting because it draws heavily on the imagery of optics (one of Calvino&amp;rsquo;s obsessions). It makes a reference to the 19th century British scientist David Brewster for his invention of the kaleidoscope. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t read about Brewster before so I had to look him up. He was so much more than the inventor of kaleidoscope.</description>

      <description>In V., Chapter 14, Pynchon made passing references to the Dreyfus Affair - a social controversy that divided France near the end of the 19th century. Just by coincidence, I read something about it earlier this year. The Father Brown story &amp;ldquo;The Duel of Dr Hirsch&amp;rdquo; by G.K. Chesterton is a very odd detective story, because it&amp;rsquo;s really a commentary on the Dreyfus Affairs.
The other historical figure that plays a more significant role in V.</description>

      <description>As a PhD student, I took a class in animal behaviour. I didn’t work very hard and have forgotten most of it. However, since I became a father, I have been thinking more about this class. One of the papers I read was the classic &amp;ldquo;The social function of the intellect&amp;rdquo; by Nicholas Humphrey, first published in 1976. The paper is packed with insightful analogies. For example, Humphrey offered an interesting interpretation of Robinson Crusoe.</description>

      <description>An obscure historical note from Thomas Pyhcon’s novel V.: there is a Chopin museum in the Spanish island of Mallorca, where you can see a cast of Frédéric Chopin’s hand. Chopin spent a winter there in 1838.</description>

      <description>In Thomas Pynchon&amp;rsquo;s first novel V., there is a subplot involving rhinoplasty. A surgeon in the story (“being a conservative”) refers to his own profession as the “Art of Tagliacozzi”. This is reference to the 16th century surgeon Gaspare Tagliacozzi, who pioneered surgical techniques for nasal reconstruction. He was a professor of anatomy at the Archiginnasio of Bologna, whose famous anatomical theatre houses a statue of Tagliacozzi holding a nose. I visited Bologna in 2015.</description>

      <title>Notes for Collection of Sand - essays by Italo Calvino</title>
      <link>https://www.hhyu.org/posts/calvino_sand/</link>

      <description>Collection of Sand is a collection of book reviews, exhibition reviews and travelogues that Italo Calvino wrote in the 70&amp;rsquo;s and 80&amp;rsquo;s. The quality varies. The best of them are unsurprisingly ekphrastic essays where Calvino described gardens, historical sites, and paintings in exquisite details. Those where he tried to regurgitate scientific or historical knowledge from academic books are less inspiring. But still, it is the variety of things that Calvino cared to write about that charms.</description>

      <title>Who did the first computer simulation of a biological neuron?</title>

      <description>Nobel laureates Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley are sometimes called the fathers of computational neuroscience, because they developed the first mathematical theory to explain how neurons communicate with each other with electrical signals. I read in a textbook that when they published their model in 1952, all the numerical calculations were done manually, because the computer at Cambridge was not working. It was &amp;ldquo;computational&amp;rdquo; all right, but it was the labour intensive variety.</description>

      <description>I saw this book in the Melbourne Rare Book Fair. To anyone who can read Chinese, this looks like the practice book of a young child starting to learn to write. The characters are intelligible, but the writer clearly has not mastered the basic principles. If Chinese characters are people, these little guys are seriously deformed. Some have really big heads, some have tiny feet, most of them look like zombies walking with their body parts dangling, ready to fall off.</description>

      <description>On university corridors, you inevitably see old equipments lying around. But which department threw out an entire freaking VAX?
Those must be the famous &amp;ldquo;blinkenlights&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>What was the first time that we know that non-human animals have color vision? From what I can find, the first person who scientifically came to that conclusion was John Lubbock in 1888. What was so strange about it was that he studied Daphnia - a plankton (!). He discovered that the plankton was attracted to yellow light, but not to white light. Lubbock also reasoned that insects must have color vision, but was not able to scientifically demonstrate it.</description>

      <description>What is known as the visual cortex today was thought to be the site of &amp;ldquo;philoprogenitivty” (parental love) in phrenology.</description>
