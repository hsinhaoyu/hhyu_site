      <description>How the sausage is made: a tutorial on building a personal website I started this website in 2018, because I wanted to collect all my content in one single place, and I wanted to build it with very simple tools. I had used several blogging platforms in the past, but was never happy with any one of them. So I decided to build something almost from scratch, to suit my personal needs.</description>

      <description>A recent paper shows that our vision is so sensitive to light that human subjects can detect the presence of one single photon shot into their retinas. While scientists have been trying to establish the lower limit of visual sensitivity for a very long time, and it is generally accepted that a small number of photons are sufficient for detection since the 40â€™s, new advances in quantum optics finally allow us to manipulate light at single photon precision, and it is the first time that direct evidence for single photon sensitivity is demonstrated in a psychological experiment.</description>
