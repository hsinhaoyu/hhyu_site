      <description>The Economist is probably not the best place to look for rigorous scholarship on comparative punnology, but a recent article did ask a very good question: Why English is such a great language for puns? I am not sure if the superiority of English in punning is that obvious, but the argument seems to be convincing:
 For English is unusually good for puns. It has a large vocabulary and a rich stock of homophones from which puns can be made.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Once I had a girl, or should I say, she once had me&amp;rdquo; sang John Lennon in Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown), the second track of the classic Beatles album Rubber Soul. Released in 1965, this innovative composition, widely considered a Rock and Roll canon heralding the maturation of the relatively young art form, immortalized John Lennon&amp;rsquo;s extramarital affair with an unidentified woman, popularized the use of the sitar in Western music, and unintentionally led to the creation of one of the most clich√©d imageries in Asia.</description>
