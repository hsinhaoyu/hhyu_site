      <description>For text processing, I had never bothered to learn classic Unix tools such as sed and awk, because I can always use Python&amp;#39;s regular expression library. The syntax of sed and awk just appeared to be too arcane to me. However, recently I realize that for many simple ad-hoc tasks, even writing a Python script is too much overhead. This motivated me to learn to use regular expressions directly in the command line.</description>
