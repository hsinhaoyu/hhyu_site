      <description>One music album that I used to play a lot of was called Night of Short Lives. It was published in the 90&amp;rsquo;s under the artist name Frame Cut Frame. It&amp;rsquo;s very hard to describe what kind of music it was. The publisher called it &amp;ldquo;unclassical music&amp;rdquo;, because the music had the classical texture, but not the classical form.
The CD was just one of those random things that I had.</description>

      <description>I bought this jam made from the native Australian plant finger lime Citrus australasica. I wasn’t expecting much because with enough sugar, all jams taste alike. But this is very different. At the first taste, it’s like a citrus but then the citrus taste is replaced by something very bitter. It’s weird. I will have no problem finishing this jar.

      <description>I walked past Melbourne University’s Grainger Museum, which is dedicated to the Australian composer Percy Grainger. Kudos to the Wiggles for adapting one of his compositions into a children’s song.
