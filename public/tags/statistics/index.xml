      <description>The Simpson&amp;rsquo;s Paradox is one of the most well-known paradoxes in statistics. A quick google will find plenty of blog posts (many from the data science community, about this puzzling phenomenon). It is clearly a topic of real-world importance. There seem to be some important lessons that we are supposed to learn from it. But what are those lessons? Is it nothing more than a cautionary tale about how easy it is for data analyses to go wrong?</description>

      <description>A colleague recommended a book called &amp;ldquo;Computer Age Statistical Inference&amp;rdquo; by Efron &amp;amp; Hastie. I love the organization. Part I - classical stuff. Part II - Early computer-age methods. Part III - 21st century topics. That&amp;rsquo;s exactly the type of textbooks that we need.</description>
