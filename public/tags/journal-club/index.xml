      <description>A recent paper published in PNAS titled &amp;ldquo;The Fermi-Dirac distribution provides a calibrated probabilistic output for binary classifiers&amp;rdquo; caught my attention, because it describes a surprising relationship between machine learning and quantum physics. In fact, surprising is an understatement. Mind-boggling is more like it. According to the analogy developed by the authors, positive samples in binary classification problems are like&amp;hellip; fermions?! What?! I decided that I should try to understand the gist of this paper, at least to the extent that I can.</description>
