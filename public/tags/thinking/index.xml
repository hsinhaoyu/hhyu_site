      <description>The Simpson&amp;rsquo;s Paradox is one of the most well-known paradoxes in statistics. A quick google will find plenty of blog posts (many from the data science community, about this puzzling phenomenon). It is clearly a topic of real-world importance.

Is it nothing more than a cautionary tale about how easy it is for data analyses to go wrong?</description>
